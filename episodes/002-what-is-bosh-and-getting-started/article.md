In this tutorial we get started with a local version of BOSH called [bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) and start to introduce some of the concepts and terminology.

But first, why BOSH?

We're being asked to operate an increasing number of increasingly complex systems. We have to make changes with increasing frequency, across an increasing number of data centres/cloud regions. All the while we have increasing user base with increasingly critical business objectives.

BOSH is a project that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software. BOSH can provision and deploy software over hundreds of VMs. It also performs monitoring, failure recovery, and software updates with zero-to-minimal downtime.
